# CK3 Modifier List

Modifiers are applied to different scopes.

Note that there are two different things that the game calls "modifier". The first is a long term bonus or penalty that is applied to a character, dynasty, or other game item. The second is something that changes the chances of random effects happening. They are both called "modifier" but they are not related.
